                Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising aagency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

                Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

                JavaScript (ES6+)
                TypeScript
                React
                Angular
                Node.jsx
                Python
                Java
            </div>
            <div className="box-2 img-box">
                <img src="profile_1.png" alt="" />
            </div>
        </div>
    )
